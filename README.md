I am a 17 year old male born on January 22, 2003. I was originally born in Tianjin, China. When I was around a few weeks old due to unknown circumstances I was burned.

# 50 word description about my career plans
When I leave school I want to earn money to go to Ecola Bible Institute in Cannon Beach Oregon. the reason I want to go there is I want to build up my faith at a bible college and my brother has gone and recommended it.it is also close to where my family lives since my mother is from Oregon originally. I feel that going away from home will help give me a new experience and help me figure out what I want to do with my life.
