      <h3>Who I Am</h3>
      <article>
        <p>I am a 17 year old male born on January 22, 2003. I was originally born in Tianjin, China. When I was around a few weeks old due to unknown circumstances I was burned. I was adopted at around 9 months to missionaries from Canada. I got  medical help and a better living situation.
          I have 3 older brothers and an older sister, one of my brothers is married with two kids.
           I also have a younger sister I have lived in China until 2013 and in Canada for 7 years and speak English and some mandarin.

      <h3>Career Plans</h3>
      <article>
        <p>When I leave school I want to earn money to go to Ecola Bible Institute in Cannon Beach Oregon. the reason I want to go there is I want to build up my faith at a bible college.
           My brother has gone and recommended it.it is also close to where my family lives since my mother is from Oregon originally.
            I feel that going away from home will help give me a new experience and help me figure out what I want to do with my life.
